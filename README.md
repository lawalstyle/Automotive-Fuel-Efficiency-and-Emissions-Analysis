# Automotive Fuel Efficiency and Emissions Analysis

This project provides an analysis of vehicle fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions. Using data from the year 2000, it offers insights into the average fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for various car makes. This analysis can help understand the environmental impact and efficiency of different car manufacturers.

## Project Structure

- `FuelEfficiencyEmissions.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `FuelConsumption.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset `FuelConsumption.csv` includes information about various car makes and models, along with their engine size, number of cylinders, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions for the year 2000.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Grouping data by car make.
- Calculating mean fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
- Visualizing the results with bar plots.

## Visualizations

The project generates two bar charts:
- Average CO2 emissions by car make.
- Average fuel consumption by car make.

These visualizations help in comparing different manufacturers regarding environmental impact and fuel efficiency.

## Setup and Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment. To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
